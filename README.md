# co-authorship
I was provided with a snapshot from DBLP. This network contains
information about researchers and their work. The nodes represent people
and the edges represent co-authorship. If two researchers have collaborated
on at least one paper, then there exists an edge that connects them. 
As supporting material, I was also given, for each researcher, the most 
important terms from the titles of their papers and their respective frequencies.
